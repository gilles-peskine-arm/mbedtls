/**
 * \file mbedtls/config_mbedtls_from_psa.h
 * \brief Construct an Mbed TLS crypto configuration (MBEDTLS_xxx) from the
 *        PSA crypto configuration (PSA_WANT_xxx).
 *
 * Do not include this header directly! It is automatically included
 * by public headers as needed.
 *
 * Do not edit this file to configure Mbed TLS. Instead, please edit
 * include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h for MBEDTLS_XXX settings or
 * include/psa/crypto_config.h for PSA_WANT_XXX settings.
 *
 * This file is used when #MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C and #MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG
 * are enabled. It ensures that the requested PSA mechanisms have an
 * implementation.
 *
 * This file enables the necessary cryptographic primitives through the
 * Mbed TLS legacy API as needed to implement the mechanisms requested
 * through the PSA configuration (with PSA_WANT_xxx symbols definde in
 * include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h or a user-defined configuration file).
 * Legacy features that are not necessary are omitted. In particular, if
 * a feature is fully provided by an accelerator driver (MBEDTLS_ACCEL_xxx),
 * the corresponding legacy feature will not be activated.
