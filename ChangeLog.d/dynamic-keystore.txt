Features
   * When the new compilation option MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_DYNAMIC is enabled,
     the number of volatile PSA keys is virtually unlimited, at the expense
     of increased code size. This option is off by default, but enabled in
     the default mbedtls_config.h. Fixes #9216.

Bugfix
   * MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_COUNT is now limited to 4096 when
     MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_DYNAMIC is disabled. Higher values could prevent
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_BUILTIN_KEYS from working properly, and have bad
     performance.
