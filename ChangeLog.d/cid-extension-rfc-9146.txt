API changes
   * The Connection ID (CID) DTLS extension is now compatible with
     RFC 9146 by default. Define MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CONNECTION_ID_COMPAT to 1
     to use the extension identifier from drafts that was used in previous
     versions of Mbed TLS. This replaces the configuration option
     MBEDTLS_TLS_EXT_CID which is no longer supported.
     This change was released in Mbed TLS 3.3.0, but not announced.
