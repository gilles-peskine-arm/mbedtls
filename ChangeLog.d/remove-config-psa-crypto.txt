Changes
   * Remove configs/config-psa-crypto.h, which was identical to the default
     configuration except for having some extra cryptographic mechanisms
     enabled and for unintended differences. This configuration was primarily
     intended to demonstrate the PSA API, and lost most of its usefulness when
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C became enabled by default.
