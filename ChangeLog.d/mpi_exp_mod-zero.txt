Bugfix
   * Fix a null pointer dereference when mbedtls_mpi_exp_mod() was called with
     A=0 represented with 0 limbs. Up to and including Mbed TLS 2.26, this bug
     could not be triggered by code that constructed A with one of the
     mbedtls_mpi_read_xxx functions (including in particular TLS code) since
     those always built an mpi object with at least one limb.
     Credit to OSS-Fuzz. Fixes #4641.

Changes
   * mbedtls_mpi_read_binary(), mbedtls_mpi_read_binary_le() and
     mbedtls_mpi_read_string() now construct an mbedtls_mpi object with 0 limbs
     when their input has length 0. Note that whether an mpi object has leading
     zeros is in general an implementation detail and can change at any time.
